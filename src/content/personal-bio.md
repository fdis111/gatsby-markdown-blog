# François Disubi

Hey, I'm **François Disubi**,

A dynamic full stack developer.

I help developers to rise to incompetence and I accompany companies in the implementation of digital tools to optimize their workflows.

Currently I work at Kinshasa Digital Academy as a full-stack developer trainer.

My tasks consist in :

- Prepare training sessions,
- Follow up on the learners' skills development
- And manage projects

In my free time (and even when I'm working), I love listening to music.

You can find me on GitHub, Linkedin, Instagram You can email me at disubif@gmail.com

If you like my work, you can buy me a coffee.
